# What is this?

A report describing a CNN model architecture that can be used for recognizing digits in the MNIST dataset.

# Why was this report written?

I wrote this technical report in my time as an exchange student in the University of Vaasa for a machine learning course. I'm putting it here now in hopes of helping people out with the practical aspect of building a simple CNN using Keras with TensorFlow backend (though I'm pretty sure there are better ways to do this now).

# Why is there no code?

I just realized I lost the code for this project but the paper includes all the details for building the network though at this point the architecture and the technology used here may be deprecated or no longer available. Although, fret not, building such networks is easier than ever and tools such as PyTorch and Scikit can be used to easily build the CNN in the paper.
